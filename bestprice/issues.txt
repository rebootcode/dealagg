1. when we search for iphone5, problem is that many sites will show books and accesories for iphone 5 including phone price also. 
so we need to sort them by category and show it to user based on popular category.

2. the product name many contain many extra word before or after the actual work searched by user. so need to find proper text match solution for it.

3. also it will depend on website basis how many products to choose from search page, beacuse search results are many times category wise.
like in many sites it may return iphone accesories with user it looking for mobile.

4. sites like shopclues shows product price for each seller so there can be 15 different seller for each product, 
while site like tradus groups all seller together product based. so different algo for different sites.



5. PreIndexing of Data to shop step2 like Kbooksearch: Issues is which ever site we use, 
that site will get more good results since the name of product will be matching to that only.
Also this is useful only when try to fix on a perticular product, like when we search samsung galaxy s
we needto show s2,s3 etc but site like flipkart mein samsung galaxy s2 block color etc which is not good.



for finding best match and grouping

1. need to parse product page
2. group by price range and name of product
3. group by category
